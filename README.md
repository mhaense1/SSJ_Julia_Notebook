# SSJ Julia notebook

This repository provides a notebook demonstrating how one can solve a simple Heterogeneous Agents business cycle model using the Sequence Space Jacobian method by [Auclert et al. (2021)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3982/ECTA17434) in Julia.

How does this notebook differ from other resources?
* Everything is implemented from scratch, not relying on a blackbox package
* The Sequence Space Jacobians are obtained using Automatic Differentiation
